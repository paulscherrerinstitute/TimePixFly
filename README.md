# TimePixFly

Analysis code for TimePix3 detector at PSI.

##Issues

- The parallelization into and synchronization between threads is probably too simple to be fast
- Logging and error handling are implemented for debugging right now, which might be too slow
- Missing requirements for logging
- Missing requirements for exception handling
- Missing requirements for configuration and parameter passing
- Missing requirements for the software environment the analysis process will be embedded into
- No functional verification has been done yet
